    <h1>Sticky Tofu</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Block of firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons corn starch</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>Half a small/medium onion</li>
        <li>1-2 Cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2.5 Tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon red pepper powder</li>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat tofu dry. Cut tofu in half lengthwise, rotate 90⁰, and cut tofu into 1/2 inch pieces. Once again, pat dry both sides of the tofu pieces (this step is to reduce spatter of oil when cooking).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, toss tofu with 3 tablespoons of corn starch until evenly coated.  </li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat up 2 tablespoons of oil on medium high. Once oil sizzles on contact with tofu, place in your tofu and fry until both sides are a deep crispy brown.</li>
        <li>In a small pan, heat up a drizzle of oil on medium. While oil is heating, chop up half an onion and cook in pan for 5-10 minutes. Mince garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir together brown sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, red pepper powder and 3 tablespoons of hot water, until sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Once onion has cooked 5-10 minutes, add garlic into pan and sauté for 1 minute. After garlic has cooked with the onion, pour in the sauce, and turn heat up to medium high. Reduce mixture down until thick (this step is to stop tofu from becoming soggy when mixed with sauce)</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into tofu pan and toss until tofu is evenly coated. Keep cooking until there are no droplets of water remaining on the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice (1/3 cup uncooked rice provides good ratio) </li>
    </ol>
